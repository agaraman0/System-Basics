## Quick Reference

### Patterns Covered

| Pattern | Type | Key Use Case |
|---------|------|--------------|
| Strategy | Behavioral | Multiple interchangeable algorithms |
| Factory | Creational | Runtime object type selection |
| Singleton | Creational | Single instance needed |
| Observer | Behavioral | One-to-many notifications |
| State | Behavioral | Behavior varies with state |
| Decorator | Structural | Add features dynamically |
| Builder | Creational | Complex object construction |
| Command | Behavioral | Undo/redo, queuing |
| Template Method | Behavioral | Algorithm skeleton |
| Chain of Responsibility | Behavioral | Request processing pipeline |

### Common Comparisons

| Comparison | Quick Difference |
|------------|------------------|
| Factory vs Builder | Type selection vs Complex construction |
| Strategy vs State | Client chooses vs Internal transitions |
| Decorator vs Proxy | Add features vs Control access |
| Observer vs Mediator | Broadcast vs Central hub |
